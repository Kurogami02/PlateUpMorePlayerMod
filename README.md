# PlateUpMorePlayerMod
Mod that adds more players to PlateUp.

```Instructions:

Navigate to your plateup-folder (Where your plateup.exe is).
Extract the files from BepInEx.zip into the plateup-folder.
Start the game and wait for the main menu to load.
Close the game.
Extract the dll file from PlateUpMorePlayers.zip into plateup-folder/BepInEx/plugins.
Start the game and wait for the main menu to load.
Close the game.
Go to plateup-folder/BepInEx/config and open MorePlayers.cfg with a text editor (eg. notepad).
Change the Max players to whatever you wish between 4 and theoretically 128 (Due to it being the max steam lobbies supports.
However I have not tested it for that many players).
Change the Player confirmation count to any value between 0 and 1 (eg 0.5 for 50% of players).
This changes how many players need to ready up for things.
Save the file.
Start the game up and invite some friends! They also require the mod however!
Extra note: Everyone has to join the lobby before anyone presses the buttons to create a character.
Otherwise you will only be allowed four players. This is due to a small bug i haven't figured out yet.
